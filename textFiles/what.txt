The first in a couple of weeks, actually. Enkidu looked up, shielding his hazel eyes, the dirt on his hand rubbing against his face. The weather seemed to be holding up, today was the perfect day to go to the farmers market. He wasn’t sure what money he had to spend, or really how to count it. His stomach grumbled loudly. Maybe he was going to have to steal, though he never liked stealing. He slank through the market, blending into a colorful crowd of loud and bustling voices. He eyed a certain booth, full of ripe fruits, with a seemingly kind owner. It was always better to ask for forgiveness than permission anyway. His heartbeat quickened as he reached into the fruit basket. No one seemed to notice him and he was right about to escape when a man’s firm hand landed on his shoulder. A jolt of panic shot through him as he whipped around. Before he could even jerk away and run, a lady’s soothing voice inquired “Now what are you doing, young man? Stealing?”. Enkidu looked at her, then her (presumably) husband, fear in his eyes. He could be turned in, hurt, shot, put in juvie, so many awful things. His breathing quickened and he couldn’t think clearly. He couldn’t catch his breath, anything besides being caught would be better. How could he get out of this situation, what would he do, where could he even go? If he attracted officials to the tents he sometimes stayed at under the bridge he could get everyone there in trouble too. Where could he go?   The lady raised her hand at him. Frozen, legs refusing to move, Enkidu flinched expecting a slap. She laid her hand on his shoulder. Confused, Enkidu watched her signal her husband over, and say “Hi honey, do you need help?”.  Somehow in less than three hours, Enkidu was staying in an air-conditioned home, with three meals a day.                      The Initial Encounter   Gilgamesh woke up to the smell of waffles wafting throughout the mansion. He rolled his eyes, knowing his bratty nuisance of a sister pestered the chef until he caved. His parents were both off on another business trip, leaving the staff at her mercy. He rolled out of bed, tossed the sheets on the floor, and flung open the closet door with such force the handle came off. He knew the closet didn’t deserve his misplaced anger, but it was the closest thing to him at the time. He threw on his uniform and grabbed whatever leftover toiletries he had forgotten, a consequence that came with packing at 3 am. The previous night (or technically that morning) when he had packed his bag he couldn’t shake the dread he was feeling. It was Monday, meaning he had to return to another week of this wretched boarding school. No matter how hard he tried he couldn’t understand why his parents sent him away. He obviously wasn’t getting good grades, and it wasn’t giving him the “discipline” his parents longed for.   In the 8th grade, Gilgamesh began skipping entire weeks of school at a time, sometimes traveling to other cities instead. His teachers were so enraged they dragged his parents into monthly meetings, cutting into their work schedules. This enraged them, as they had then taken action because of it. It was entertaining to Gilgamesh how his actions only mattered to his parents when they impacted their lives.  This Monday was going to be extra horrible. Not only had football (his one true pleasure) been canceled this week (something about studying for standardized tests) but Gilgamesh had another pressing issue. After getting into destructive fights with his previous roommates, Highland Prep has given up hope and let him live in peace, with the dorm all to himself. Much to his dismay, a new student decided to show up and ruin his sanctuary. Gilgamesh prayed this pest wouldn't irritate him, his parents couldn’t handle another suspension report cutting into their workday. At the very least Gilgamesh hoped the newcomer would leave just him alone and not flock to him as the others seemed to.   He quickly snatched his coffee from the fridge (pure black, the sugary stuff was repulsive to him), threw his singular bag in the trunk of his BMW, and sped out of the driveway, blasting a “Rap Hits 2015-2020” playlist with the windows down, feeling the wind in his blond hair. He was already late but Gilgamesh couldn’t have cared less.   -  Enkidu was shaking with excitement, or maybe this was worry. Regardless, he knew he needed to calm down, or he might forget something. Though he didn’t have many belongings, he still had that horrible feeling in the pit of his stomach. As if he left his toothbrush on the bed, or deodorant in the fridge. He was brought back into his reality by his dear mother’s voice, calling him. He rushed down the stairs to find his parents standing together, with tears in their eyes and grinning from ear to ear. A camera was whipped out of nowhere, cueing Enkidu to raise his hands to cover his face and say “Really Mom?”. She snapped what seemed like a million pictures with a blinding flash. After he could see again, Enkidu was immediately overwhelmed with bittersweet happiness. He knew he didn’t deserve such amazing parents and felt overwhelming guilt over leaving home, but knew this would make them beyond proud. Not only had he gotten a full academic scholarship, but he got to live on campus and eat free meals. He even got a roommate, and Enkidu couldn’t wait to live with someone his age.   Enkidu’s fears slowly came back, remembering this was a whole new experience. He didn’t know how he would fit in with these posh kids, or if they would accept him into their “cliques” since he didn’t have the same cars and clothes. Hell, he still had an iPhone 5 that crashed more than his previous school’s Chromebooks. He heard wild stories from friends at his old school; about Highland kids and their impudent attitudes. Enkidu grabbed his phone, checking to see if his friends answered his texts. Nothing, as expected. He told them he was moving 3 weeks ago, expecting them to be happy for him, as he was finally getting the education he needed to be successful. Their reaction was quite the opposite.  Suddenly, everyone was too busy to hang with him, or even answer his texts. Now the people he had considered friends whispered rumors and “traitor” behind his back. Enkidu went to the sink and splashed water on his face, letting the sensation calm him. He looked up into the mirror and reminded himself this was his new start, and he was finally where he needed to be. Hopefully, he could make new, better friends and learn new things. With this, he snatched his last bag, carried it to the car, and hopped in. He was leaving 2 hours earlier than he really needed, but for a good reason. This way, if the car broke down again he still wouldn’t be late.   -  Gilgamesh slowly got out of his car and walked onto campus, making his way straight to his locker. He didn’t have the energy or time to have a pointless conversation with his “friends”, who felt more like fans to him. He turned the last corner, looking down and scrolling through his socials, bursting with notifications. He muted them all and continued, sliding his phone in his pocket. Then his phone buzzed. “Damn it, what’s wrong with this stupid phone?” he muttered, checking his phone. His eyes widened. It was his parents.   He had silenced any other notifications because the massive amount he would receive from group chats and what not had become bothersome. He left his parents on, though he wasn’t quite sure why. Maybe it was hope. That’s why the little blue box on the top of his phone shocked him. It startled him so much so he stopped dead in his walk. Not even a second later, he was jolted forward. The steaming coffee slipped out of his hands and felt the scorching heat on this torso before he saw it. Impulsive rage boiled inside of him as he swung around to see which little brat managed to make this terrible day even worse. He was then towering over a cowering, meager boy mumbling something that vaguely sounded like “Sorry”. That sorry apology wasn't enough for Gilgamesh, already prepared to unleash his displaced wrath on him.  -  Enkidu was so concentrated on finding his locker, he practically didn’t notice the gathering of people in the middle of the hall. In the center of the group, he spotted two students, a tall, blond, and soaking wet teenager towering over a trembling student, who looked like a child in comparison. He leaned to the girl closest and asked “What’s going on? Who’s the big one?” she replied, “That’s Gilgamesh, and that’s some rando, he just bumped into him and probably about to be annihilated.” from behind him he heard someone else sigh. “Poor Jim, he's probably gonna be hospitalized. He didn't even mean it.” Enkidu was astonished at the fact a fellow classmate was being threatened so harshly for an honest mistake. This was probably the worst thing he could do on day one but Enkidu knew he couldn’t stand by and watch this go down.  He pushed his way to the center and stood face to face with the blondie. He wasn’t quite sure what his next move would be, but at least Jim wouldn’t be hurt. The tall boy stared at him with an amused look.   -  Gilgamesh smirked. Never before had anyone ever stood up to him, much less a nobody like this kid. He didn’t recognize this person, and clearly the audience didn’t either. The boy obviously didn’t know who Gilgamesh was, as no one is ever idiotic enough to bother disagreeing with him. Looking him up and down, Gilgamesh evaluated his competitor and stepped closer, curious about how he would react.  -  Enkidu didn’t want to be in any fights, especially not on his first day. This Gilga-something was intimidating, but clearly testing Enkidu. He knew as soon as he hit, his opponent would hit him twice as hard. Instead, he decided to use his words, trying to stay civil. He asked Gilgamesh, “That person accidentally bumped into you, but you were ready to hospitalize him? Are you always such an asshole?” The smirk instantly faded from Gilgameshed’s mouth, his eyes narrowing in anger. “What. Did. You. Call. Me?”, he replied, visibly trying to conceal his astonishment. Enkidu knew he had offended him, and this fight had just become personal. Before he could even think of how to respond he saw Gilgamesh begin to swing. Instinctively, he caught his fist and twisted his arm backward, something he learned when living on the streets.   -  Gilgamesh was taken back by this. Not only was the competitor roughly his size, but he could fight as well? Feeling evenly matched was an unfamiliar feeling. It was… nice. Regardless, Gilgamesh still needed to win to prove his dominance to the rest of his hopeless schoolmates. He used his leg, kicking the boy back off balance. Then, using both arms and his momentum he threw him against the wall, watching him crumble. He was just about to walk away when he hesitated. Something inside him was pulling him back, telling him to turn around. Listening to the gut feeling, he approached the struggling boy, reaching out a hand. The confusion in his eyes reflected Gilgamesh’s own thoughts, but nonetheless, the boy grabbed his extended hand. As they stood he muttered “Thanks, sorry about calling you a jerk”, his face flushing. Gilgamesh replied “Asshole, I believe it was.” smiling at his gentle eyes, “I’m Gilgamesh, by the way.”. “Enkidu” he replied. When they were both upright Enkidu turned to Gilgamesh and asked “Where's your first class?”. It took him a second to remember, considering he never really attended. 9 am was much too early to deal with people. “Science 101, how about you?”, he said. “Same!” Enkidu replied enthusiastically. “Do you think you could show me where it is?” Though Gilgamesh seldom showed people around (or helped anyone at all for that matter) he decided he could make an exception for Enkidu. Together, the two of them walked to Mr.Sindaco’s room, their fellow classmates bewildered as Gilgamesh was seeming to tolerate Enkidu.   -  After the long day, Enkidu almost forgot about his new room. He never found time to unpack, so he walked out to his car and grabbed all 6 bags at once, dragging them to his dorm hallway. He found room number 7 and knocked politely on the door. A man inside grunted “It's open, dipshit”, which slightly offended Enkidu. Pushing the door open with his foot, he placed down the bags to find an absolute mess of a room, lone socks and dirty clothes littering the floor. There were two twin size beds, opposite of each other against the far wall. One was bare and the other a complete disaster. There were mounds of leftover food boxes and wrappers folded within the sheets. Not to mention, the place smelled atrocious. With a sigh, Enkidu brought the bags in, ignoring the rude roommate who was sitting in front of a mounted flatscreen TV on the dirtiest couch known to mankind. He turned his back to him, silently deciding to ignore him, and began unpacking, though who he was piqued Enkidu’s interest.  -  Gilgamesh was watching the Eagles absolutely destroy the Cowboys when his new roommate finally showed up. He couldn’t have cared less about the mess and the horrible impression he was making, though he was slightly curious how the roommate would react. Living with a slob like himself had disgusted his parents so much they pushed him to the room farthest away from the rest of the house, essentially sending him into exile. Maybe this guy would do something similar, like pushing his bed to the opposite corner and drawing a line (as the first roommate had). Gilgamesh was so used to this response from others it had begun to amuse him. He was interested to see what creative response would come this time. He thought to himself, “Might as well ignore the new guy for now.” and went back to paying his attention to the game. After 10 minutes halftime began and Gilgamesh’s patience had worn thin. He stood to grab a snack and finally get a good look at his annoying new roommate and predict how long he’d last.  Though he was still unpacking, Gilgamesh immediately recognized him by the messy hair and strong frame. The recognition sent a wave of panic through him. He was the last person Gilgamesh expected to see standing there. His new roommate, whom he would share the space and time with, was Enkidu. How had he not put two and two together? He was overwhelmed with embarrassment for his living state, as he apologized and rushed to pick up the mess. His cheeks reddened, why did he care so much about Enkidu seeing his filth anyways?   Enkidu turned around and smiled politely as he said to Gilgamesh, “Don’t worry about it, we can clean later. Sorry I didn’t give you more notice.” Relieved he sat back down and offered Enkidu a seat, as he struck a conversation about the only thing he could talk about, football.  -  When he realized it was Gilgamesh who’d be living with him, Enkidu felt a little more at ease. Maybe living in room number 7 wouldn’t be a living nightmare, though he would have to help him clean up a little. Initially, he was offended at the rudeness of his roommate, but after spending the day with Gilgamesh he knew this treatment wasn’t personal. Though he was guarded, Enkidu knew there was a soft side to him. Right then, he decided to make it his personal mission to find it.   Gilgamesh offered him a seat and began explaining the game he was watching. Enkidu didn’t need a lesson on football, but he could tell how much joy it gave Gilgamesh. Enkidu sat there, admiring his new roommates smile while he droned on about the Eagles lack of defense and how much better he would do on that field.                   Robbing Ms.Humming   The entire class was in a frenzy, and even Gilgamesh was on edge. In two days they had a test that would decide whether they stayed in Highland or not. No one wanted to be kicked out for stupidity, not even Gilgamesh. Ever since he met Enkidu he began to care a little more. Having someone that knows you intimately can really change someone's perspective. Gilgamesh had never had a friend before, much less a compassionate best friend. Enkidu easily took that spot in less than 2 weeks.   On Tuesday night Gilgamesh was talking with Enkidu, as it had recently become a daily occurrence. Enkidu was sharing his worries about the test when Gilgamesh envisioned a grand scheme. Together, they were going to save the class of 2021 by stealing the answer key. Enkidu would talk to the teachers (who all adored him) and get the information about the location of the documents. Later that night, together they would sneak to the south side of campus, take pictures, and share them with everyone excluding the staff, using Enkidu's superior computer skills. It was a flawless plan, and they would be heroes remembered by the student body forever. Gilgamesh loved the idea of self-promoting and wanted the same for Enkidu. He explained the idea, to which Enkidu agreed. It was to happen the next night.  -  Enkidu was nervous, as he had never abused a teacher-student relationship before, not at least to this extent. Obviously, he had bargained for extensions on essays and rounding up grades, but never something so drastic. What if he got caught?! He couldn't get the image of his disappointed parents out of his head. After a couple of deep breaths, he opened his phone and called Gilgamesh. “You ready?” he asked. Enkidu nodded, then realized Gilgamesh wouldn’t be able to see him. He replied, “Yep, Operation ‘Win’ is in motion.”. He placed the phone in his pocket (while still on the call, so Gilgamesh would hear), gulped down his fear, put a smile on his face, and opened the door to Ms. Cooper’s room.   -  When the dorm room opened Gilgamesh jumped up from his bed, ruffling the once straight cover. He was overwhelmed with excitement and anticipation as his best friend returned from his mission. Enkidu had locked the door behind, and only then did Gilgamesh reveal his surprise. Today, he had skipped out on the 4th period (the only class they had apart) and bought them matching ski masks. Enkidu balled over laughing, swearing he would die before he put that on.  -  When the clock struck 12, Enkidu was by the door, ready to begin their journey (wearing his ski mask as he couldn’t handle a Gilgamesh tantrum right now.) Gilgamesh was just about ready, though he still needed to tie his shoes. He was currently wearing one sock since Enkidu did the laundry that day and Gilgamesh still had yet to retrieve it. Afterward, the heroic pair were finally ready to begin.   Creaking open the door, they slowly tiptoed out and locked it behind them. Sprinting down the hall to the exit door, Gilgamesh gave a shocked look to Enkidu. “Oh shoot”, he exclaimed, terror slowly rushing through him. Enkidu had already disabled the alarm system remotely, so he pushed past the idiot and strutted right out, proud of his preparation. Gilgamesh stalled for a minute in admiration, then followed out into the cold October air.  -  After running ¼ a mile Gilgamesh stopped and turned to Enkidu. They paused in the middle of the field, breathing heavily. Gilgamesh just had a vision in his head, something absolutely terrifying. What if Ms. Bier (the principal) was awake? What would they do then? He shared this fear with Enkidu who responded, “Gil, calm down, all teachers go to their rooms at 6, remember?”. With this Gilgamesh took a deep breath, wondering what he would do without Enkidu. Together they carried on into the night.  Around fifteen minutes later they arrive at last. Slowly they turned the corner and scanned the front entrance. There were two large, heavy, wooden doors that stood between them and their heroic praise. Much to Gilgamesh's surprise, Enkidu whipped out a bobby pin from his nest of hair and began working on the locks. He wondered what else Enkidu kept in there. His imagination was halted when a voice began yelling on the other side of the oak doors. Enkidu's head whipped back in shock, as the fear in his eyes caused a pang of roaring guilt in Gilgamesh. This was his idea, and it would cause his only friend suspension at the very least. He couldn't let that happen.  -  Enkidu recognized that voice anywhere, it was the awful security guard, Ms. Hummings. His life would be over if they didn’t get out now. He stood up and began to run when he felt Gilgamesh's strong grip on his right arm. He whispered in Enkidu's ear, “We can do this, just follow my lead.” as he crept back towards the door. When they heard the click of the door unlocking Gilgamesh screamed “Now!” (in a slightly dramatic fashion). With that they swung the door open, smashing Ms. Hummings in the face. She fell to the ground immediately, unconscious.   Gilgamesh gave a cheer as they walked inside, as he honestly wasn’t sure that was going to work. Enkidu tended to the beastly women, sitting her upright. Gilgamesh thought Enkidu was absolutely adorable, always taking care of people. It was compassion he had never encountered before but would die to keep. When he was done they walked to the back filing cabinet, grabbing the file on top labeled “2019 ANSWER KEY”. Gilgamesh turned to Enkidu and whispered, “We did it!”.   -  Gilgamesh's expression was irreplaceable at this moment. Enkidu was so enchanted he almost forgot to scan the papers. He whipped out his phone and began working. Less than 2 minutes later he was done, showing Gilgamesh where he had posted it. Not only was it in everyone's inbox, it was on the school’s socials and even their website (Enkidu knew this was unnecessary, but it was still funny). They snuck out the same door, Enkidu apologizing to a still asleep Ms. Hummings.  The next day there was an aura of confidence around the building. While school officials still were clueless, all the students had already screenshotted and memorized the answers. In less than two hours the test would be over, and its online presence would disappear, no evidence left. All that would be left was their A+ grades and the slight confusion of teachers. Enkidu and Gilgamesh each woke up happy, knowing they got to spend another year with each other.                 The Rejection and Confession   The last two months had gone by so fast, Gilgamesh almost didn’t notice. It was finally the Winter Holidays season, and the decorations had already been hung. Gilgamesh felt indifferent towards the celebrations. While his family did “celebrate” Christmas, it was never important. Presents weren’t special and he only went to a handful of family events. It was more stressful than enjoyable, yet the whole world didn’t seem to care. This year would be interesting, as he planned on spending most of the season with Enkidu. He wasn’t sure of what they would do, but he relied on Enkidu, knowing he would plan something they would both enjoy.  -   Enkidu adored the Christmas season, it was a light in the dark tunnel of the winter. When he was still on the streets, Christmas was the best time of the year. Though it was cold, people always seemed much more generous and kind. It made them feel good, giving helping the poor kids. When he moved in with his adoptive parents, they celebrated to a massive extent, they threw multiple parties and hosted anyone and everyone they possibly could.   Enkidu wasn't surprised at Gilgamesh's lack of enthusiasm. He had obviously never had a true, family Christmas. Enkidu decided he was going to change that. When Gilgamesh left one night to buy more convenience store snacks, he set to work. He had brought a small Christmas tree with him and lights when he moved in, waiting for this day to come. He set it up in the corner and hung the lights throughout the room. Slipping into his favorite ELF onesie, he laid Gilgameshes matching one on the bed, set up their popcorn and movie, and waited for him to return. Today was Friday, meaning they had the rest of the weekend to spend together, and Enkidu had planned every minute. He was going to make Gilgamesh love Christmas.   -  After ice-skating, intense cookie making, 3 movie marathons, and a snowball fight Gilgamesh was completely exhausted. They had one more week to go before Winter break, and Enkidu looked like he was going to burst with excitement. If he was being completely honest, Enkidu's spirit had begun to rub off on Gilgamesh. He even listened to Christmas songs with the team on their runs. He would imagine singing them together during the passing drills and hummed along. He would catch himself, remembering he needed to focus. Enkidu agreed not to bring his textbook to the next game, meaning Gilgamesh had to be on the top of his game.   -  There was the winter ball that Friday, after the longest week of Enkidu's life. This would be his first dance at Highland, and he was a little too distressed. All his classmates seemed excited, talking about how much fun it was going to be. Enkidu couldn’t stop thinking about what Gilgamesh would do. He knew he had previous girlfriends, but they never really discussed them. Would he dance with someone? He was even more puzzled at why he cared so much. As his teacher drowned on about some useless Sumerian literature, he let his mind run through all the other, horrific possibilities. What if someone asked HIM to dance? Having never been in a relationship before, Enkidu hated to think about it. He seemed coordinated, but he couldn’t be more clumsy when he was nervous. Rejecting someone would be cruel and impolite, but he simply couldn’t bring himself to accept public humiliation. He prayed he wouldn't have to deal with any of this, and that he could have an uneventful night.  -  Gilgamesh and Enkidu were walking towards the West Wing of campus when he noticed Enkidu was fidgeting with his collar, something he only did when anxious. Gilgamesh turned to Enkidu and said, “Hey, you have Amidst US downloaded, right?”. Hesitantly, Enkidu replied, “...yes?” questioning his intentions. They reached the ballroom and opened the door to find a jumping, singing mod surrounded by tables and drink stations. Grabbing Enidu by his hand, Gilgamesh pulled him to the back corner, snatching 2 drinks on the way. He knew that away from the group Enkidu would calm down and enjoy himself. They each pulled up Amidst Us and began to play together.  After 15 minutes, Gilgamesh and Enkidu were finally Deceivers together. They were traveling around the game ship, plotting their victory when a woman approached their table. When she said his name, Gilgameshes finger slipped and he murdered, right in front of everybody. His vision went red as he looked up to discover what monster ruined their game. He immediately recognized Isabelle, the President of SuperTechs daughter. She was standing over them with one hand on her hip, flanked by her passe of loyal servants. They always seemed to be by her side, no matter what. He swore they probably followed her into the bathroom. She glanced at Enkidu before returning her eyes to the prey, Gilgamesh. “Come dance with me…” she practically whispered, suggesting much more than a simple dance.  Gilgamesh was absolutely enraged by this, as he stood up with such force he threw the chair 3 feet from the table. He released his built-up fury on her, shouting, “You’ve got to be kidding! Why in the world would I ever even touch a repulsive, manipulative, absolutely wretched creature like you! You disgust every person in this building because you're a selfish bitch with a god complex! I don’t care whose daughter you are, you're still a worthless little brat providing nothing for society. You’ve not only insulted, but humiliated and destroyed anyone who’s ever tried to help you be anything more than the self-absorbed witch you are. You get teachers fired for giving you the grade you deserve, and students expelled for reminding you what a horrible person you truly are. You will never change, and are completely worthless to everyone and everything. So to answer your question, no, Isabelle, I will not dance with you. I will not date you. And I will most likely rid my mind of your toxic existence. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I would like to go back to playing Amidst Us with Enkidu, a person who is worthy, considerate, beautiful, and kind. Something you couldn’t buy with all the money in the world.” With this, he picked up his chair with grace, sat down gently, and started another game.   -  She scowled at him, sending the message with her narrowed eyes that he would very much pay for this.  -  The night of the dance Enkidu laid in his bed, playing Trivia Smash with Gilgamesh. He wasn’t paying much attention, and therefore losing horribly. His thoughts were completely occupied thinking about what happened earlier, and the real reason why Gilgamesh may have lashed out. Gilgamesh was acting as if nothing had happened, playing the game with complete and utter focus. When the round had ended it was his turn to spin, but instead, he sat up and looked at Gilgamesh, ready to find the truth. Though he was frightened beyond measure, he knew Gilgamesh wouldn’t take the next step alone, and he needed to know how he felt. In the last 5 years, Enkidu went from having no one to care and love for, and he had 3 (his parents included). He couldn’t stay quiet and watch Gilgamesh bottle up feelings, it was unnatural for him. In addition, Enkidu was tired of pretending for himself.  -  Gilgamesh knew tonight’s little disaster was going to come up eventually and was drastically trying to avoid it. When they began playing he knew Enkidu’s head was somewhere else, as Enkidu normally destroyed Gilgamesh in the game. He put down his phone and asked him, “What's wrong?” his voice was steady though his breathing was shaky. He was surprised when Enkidu asked, quietly, “Did you really mean what you said?”. He breathed a sigh of relief and said “Absolutely, Isabelle is the most-''. “That's not what I meant…” Enkidu replied, cutting him off. “You think I’m… beautiful and kind?” he asked, voice creaking with the last syllable.   Gilgamesh panicked. He knew he had loved Enkidu, but what if he didn’t reciprocate those same feelings. He had been confused ever since meeting the boy, and now he had to face those fears. Initially, he thought he had mistaken romantic feelings for platonic ones, and ignored that his mind was saying otherwise. Over time he grew to appreciate everything about Enkidu, from his little quirks to his glowing smile. He couldn’t imagine losing him, and if he found out this could quite possibly be the case. He felt something damp on his face. What was this? A tear?! He tried to answer Enkidu's question, planning on brushing it off and insisting on sleeping. Friends call each other that stuff all the time. It was nothing to get worked up about. When he opened his mouth to speak, he let out a croak and choked out “Y-y-yes”. Unexpectedly, his eyes began to fill with tears as he turned away, shoving his face into a pillow. His dam for emotions had just been broken, and there was no stopping the water now.  -  Enkidu couldn’t ever have imagined Gilgamesh crying, but now he was having a breakdown right in front of him. Without even processing what was going on, he instinctively jumped out of his bed and walked over to Gilgamesh’s. Enkidu carefully took the pillow and pulled his quivering head towards his own chest. He sat there with Gilgamesh in his arms, silently ensuring his constant support. He leaned down, resting his cheek on Gilgamesh's shoulder and said “I love you too”. Then he slowly leaned back, pulling sobbing Gilgamesh closer and laid there together for what seemed like an eternity.                 The Transfer   When Enkidu walked into class on Monday he had a horrible feeling, for seemingly no reason. He assumed it was the fact his wonderful break had just ended, and he had to return back to cold, dark Pennsylvania. Over the break, Enkidu brought Gilgamesh home, introducing him as a friend. During their small celebration, Gilgamesh finally got a taste of the warm, fuzzy feeling of a family Christmas. Enkidu could tell his parents were suspicious of his new friend, as they were prone to judging on first appearances.   Afterward, Gilgamesh took Enkidu on a fun and luxurious trip to Turks and Caicos. They spent 4 days and 5 nights relaxing by the beach and partying in the nights. Enkidu hadn’t been able to believe the houses and yachts he saw, and Gilgamesh found his astonishment amusing.   -  Little did Enkidu know, his feeling was not incorrect at all. While Enkidu and Gilgamesh enjoyed their break together, Isabelle was busy plotting her revenge. Through the commotion, they had completely forgotten about her silent threat. Currently, she was collecting her evidence and hiring investigators. She would make them both pay for embarrassing her. She would come out of nowhere, like a bull, and destroy their lives.  -  When Gilgamesh turned on his phone that afternoon, he was surprised to see a text from Isabelle. He assumed she would never talk to him again, which he was completely content with. He opened it, and then impulsively chucked his phone into the wall, barely missing Enkidu's head. “Jesus Christ!”, Enkidu exclaimed. “Which color murdered you this time?”, he asked, referring to Amidst Us. Gilgamesh looked up and flatly said, dead serious, “It’s Isabelle, she knows everything.”  -  Enkidu's smile was wiped off his face. What in the world could he possibly mean, ‘everything’? He snatched Gilgamesh's phone from the wall, guessed his password (1,2,3,4), and looked at the message. There were 30+ images of varying subjects. There was security footage of them stealing the answer key and screenshots from everywhere they had posted it. There were images of Enkidu before he was adopted, exposing his social class. There were even images exposing their relationship, from the night of the dance to their vacation. Enkidu exclaimed “How the hell did she do this! Honestly was she that upset?” He contemplated the idea of these being released, shuddering at just the thought. Though he loved his parents, their old school views would never approve of either his theft or relationship. He understood how devastated Gilgamesh would be as well, considering he would immediately be kicked off the football team (as stealing something [especially this important] broke school rules).  -  They knew they needed to go any extent to prevent this, and fast. Enkidu whipped out his computer, while Gilgamesh slipped on his shoes and went to pay Isabelle a visit. He stormed across campus until he found her, sitting with her pawns on the lawn. Her phone was sitting on the ground behind her, and Gilgamesh was sprinting towards it. He snagged it and chucked it into the stone fountain. Isabelle laughed unconcerned, knowing her phone was waterproof. Her laugh morphed into a shriek, as she saw it in two pieces, destroyed. She looked for Gilgamesh to strangle him, but he was already gone.  -  Meanwhile, Enkidu was typing away furiously. Not only had he erased all Isabelle's accounts, but he had placed her on multiple Internet Block Lists. He then sent reports to everyone she had hired, instructing them to destroy anything they had collected, and never contact her again under any circumstances. Not only would she have no access to her blackmail, but she wouldn’t be able to use the internet for an extended period of time.  Their success was short-lived, as the loudspeaker announced “Gilgamesh and Enkidu, please report to the office immediately.”  -  Enkidu's parents were stunned when they received his 3-day suspension report. They were glaring at their son, who seemed so distant and unrecognizable, a boy they had so much hope for. Though he was apologetic, he clearly didn’t regret his actions. This angered them even more.   “ASSAULT? SERIOUSLY?”, his father yelled. Even his mother looked angry, which was a new experience for him. Though he felt horrible, Enkidu knew they had made the right decision. 2 days out of school was infinitely better than the consequences of those images being released. Enkidu was ignoring the lecture he was given until he heard his mother say, “I knew that Gilgamesh kid was going to be a problem.” Enkidu immediately jumped to his defense, taking full responsibility. “This isn’t his fault! It’s Isabelle’s!” he yelled, sounding much too childish. His parents gave him a stern look, signaling him to go to his room. With this Enkidu walked away, questioning the lack of punishment.  On Wednesday morning, Enkidu returned back to school still without penalization from his folks. Maybe the sheer disappointment was enough for them. Nonetheless, he was thrilled to be seeing Gilgamesh again. He met him in the parking lot, and together they walked to their dorm.  When they approached the door, Gilgamesh saw a strange sign hanging off the doorknob.    Dear Mr.Enkidu, Due to your requested transfer, You will need to pack all your things to be shipped this afternoon. Anything left will be discarded.  -Highland Transfer Department    Gilgamesh was frozen in fear. He couldn’t lose Enkidu now, not after everything. Enkidu had just opened an email, stating he was being moved to a disciplinary section of Highland, across the country in Wyoming. The two boys stood completely still outside the doorway, not sure of what to say.   -  When everything was in boxes, Gilgamesh and Enkidu embraced one another for one last time before he was to leave. Gilgamesh was being slightly melodramatic, considering he wasn’t being swept away from everything he loved; his boyfriend, his school, his life. Regardless, Enkidu couldn’t help but admire the compassionate person Gilgamesh had grown to be. Initially, he resented his parents for flipping his life upside down. After consideration, he realized he was thankful, for they caused him to meet Gilgamesh in the first place. With this sense of closure, he hopped in the car and began his flight to the airport.  -  Two weeks had passed since Enkidu's departure, and Gilgamesh had yet to leave the room. Without him, there was no point in attending class or parties or even football (when Enkidu wasn’t in the stands studying it wasn’t the same). Enkidu had purposely left him his favorite sweatshirt, which was beginning to smell yet he refused to wash it. He lied on the bed, staring at Enkidu's now bare one. He was thinking about all their amazing memories, like a highlight reel of his happiness. Nights spent with movies and video games, and days filled with fruitful conversations. He drifted off to sleep, at 3 pm once again.   The Return  (our twist because were now emotionally attached to the characters and refuse to see them suffer) Gilgamesh heard a knock on the door and sighed. His chipotle had finally arrived. He opened the door, head down with his long hair that covered his swollen eyes. He had gotten Enkidu's normal order, almost as an act of remembrance (though it had only been a month). He snatched the bag and shut the door behind him, as tears dripped into his soft-shelled tacos. The delivery man knocked again, probably with napkins and chips and whatnot. When he opened the door nothing was being handed to him, but the man said “No hello, Gil?” Gilgamesh’s head jerked up, only one person ever called him Gil. “ENKIDUUU” he yelled, throwing the tacos to the side and clobbering him with a massive bear hug. “Wait, you’re a chipotle delivery man?” he asked, puzzled. “No dumbass, I’m moving back in!”. Gilgamesh was still confused about how he got his meal, but it didn’t matter. He dashed out to Enkidu's car, grabbing the bags all at once, and sprinted back to their dorm. He threw them on his bed and looked at Enkidu, who was cleaning up the spilled tacos, just like old times. Everything was finally going to be okay.  -   They were sitting next to each other on the floor, enjoying their dinner of hot pockets and gummy bears. Enkidu was trying to explain to Gilgamesh what happened, but he had no idea where to start. The first weekend he flew home to his parents, determined to see Gilgamesh again. Once he got there he explained everything, in a desperate attempt at getting their approval. If he didn’t receive it, he had no other choice than to run away, which disrupted his life plans. He began with the fight and every significant moment afterward. He even explained how proud he was of Gilgamesh's change, though he would never reveal to Gilgamesh he shared this. He would be embarrassed that the people that once judged him so harshly were now aware of his softer side. Afterward, they politely asked him for some time to process, and he granted their request by returning to his room.   At dinner they sat him down, though Enkidu was much too nervous to eat. His mother began, “Honey, you know we love you, and we're sorry for reacting so harshly initially. We assume you understand our intentions, correct?”, Enkidu nodded, as he really did know how bad the incident looked without explanation. His father continued, explain how though they may not understand their son's relationship, they would support him in any way needed. This was all Enkidu needed to hear, as he stood up and embraced his parents, thankful for their open-mindedness. And with that, he returned to Highland, and his one true love, Gilgamesh.  -  After an hour of explanation, Enkidu was finally done elaborating on what had occurred. He listened patiently, though it didn’t quite matter to him, because at last, he had Enkidu safe in his arms. It never mattered how he got there. Gilgamesh laid there as Enkidu curled up next to him and fell asleep, visibly exhausted. While watching his breath slow, Gilgamesh wrapped his body closer to Enkidu and put a blanket over them both. In this moment he knew, this was the man he was destined to grow old with, and not time nor space would tear them apart. Illustrations:
